My name is Colin Detwiller.  I'm a passionate technologist and have been learning everything I can around software craftsmanship, cloud platforms, distributed systems, infrastructure/ops automation, and many more topics.

If any of these topics sound interesting to you than you've found the right place to come learn from all my mistakes.
